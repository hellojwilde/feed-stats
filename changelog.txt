2009-06-21  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: Increased the version number from 1.0.5 to 1.0.6.

2009-06-21  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

    * tests/client.php: Added two test cases for the client.php script.
	* client.php: Slimmed down the fs_load_feed_data and 
        fs_load_item_data functions--they included much unnecessary 
        code.

2009-06-21  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

        class_http that was originally in the fetch_remote_xml in 
        client.php.

2009-06-20  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

        rename to feed-stats-plugin.php might have broken the updater.
	* feed-stats-plugin.php (deleted): Renamed to feed-stats.php.

2009-06-20  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats-plugin.php (added): Renamed to feed-stats-plugin.php
        from feed-stats.php to make it conform to the WordPress standard
        of having the primary PHP file name match the repository name.  
        This should also speed up the performance of the plugin.
	* parser.php (added): Renamed from fs-parse.php; this makes the 
        filenames look cleaner.
	* client.php (added): Renamed from fs-comm.php; this makes the 
        filenames look cleaner.

        generated POT files look prettier.
	* templates/troubleshooting.php: Cleaned up the strings to be 
        translated so that generated POT files look prettier.

        from the plugin.

        defined in the fs_translatable_error function.

2009-06-19  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: Tweaked markup so that there's less space around 
        the "FeedBurner Dashboard" link.
	* templates/settings.php: Made the "Testing..." text for the feed
        tester translatable.
	* templates/troubleshooting.php: Added a paragraph to introduce the
        troubleshooting information.  Added a link to go back to the 
        configuration page.  Used the fs_translatable_error to output
        all of the troubleshooting information.

2009-06-19  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

        saved successfully" message into templates/settings.php.
	* templates/settings.php: Added the "Options saved successfully" 
        message from feed-stats.php.

2009-06-19  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* templates/troubleshooting.php: Fixing some syntax errors by adding
        proper closing ?> tags.

2009-06-19  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* js/test.js: Fixed the link to the troubleshooting page.

2009-06-19  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* awapi-test.php: Updated it so that it sends the code for the 
        message to the client, along with the translatable message.  
        Moved the "This feed is valid." message into the "Valid" error
        message in the fs_translatable_error function in fs-comm.php.
	* fs-comm.php: Added a "Valid" error message to the 
        fs_translatable_error function. In fs_fetch_feedburner_data, I
        replaced $response->data with $response->body.  There is no
        $response->body.  My mistake. 
	* js/test.js: Updated it so that it uses the message code, rather
        than the message, to determine whether the feed is valid or not.
        This will ensure that the script doesn't implode when the plugin
        is localized.

2009-06-19  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: Changed the the tempalate so that the error 
        message uses the messages already contained in 
        fs_translatable_error, rather than using conditional statements.
	* fs-comm.php: Fixed sprintf usage. Fixed variable names in 
        fs_fetch_feedburner_data. Added backwards compatibility for 
        people who have a feed name saved, rather than a feed URL.  
        Replaced all references to fs_make_error_translatable with 
        fs_translatable_error. Updated the fs_load_feed_data and 
        fs_load_item_data functions with the changes to the variables 
        for the fs_fetch_feedburner_data function.

2009-06-19  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* fs-comm.php: Renamed  to 
        fs_translatable_error.  I'm making it the general-purpose error 
        message manager function.  It now holds all of the errors and
        messages for the plugin. Rewrote (and documented) the 
        fs_fetch_feedburner_data function so that it now only has 
        support for the new Awareness API (the old one has been 
        completely shut down) to improve performance.  The new function, 
        combined with the fs_translatable error function, has much 
        better error checking.
    * fs-parse.php: Removed the now-obsolete fs_check_errors function, 
        which has been integrated into fs_fetch_feedburner_data;

2009-06-18  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

2009-06-16  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

        fs_make_error_translatable ($original) function. Made use of the
        _e() function to ensure that it can be localized.
	* feed-stats.php: Made use of the _e() function to ensure that it 
        can be localized.
	* fs-comm.php: Added the fs_make_error_translatable ($original) 
        function, which allows us to localize those ugly FeedBurner 
        error messages. Made use of this new function in the
        fs_fetch_feedburner_data ($url, $action, $updatable=true, $post=null)
        function.
	* fs-parse.php: Made use of the _e() function to ensure that it can 
        be localized.
	* templates/troubleshooting.php: Made use of the _e() function to 
        ensure that it can be localized.

2009-06-15  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

        Since Google fixed this, the message is no longer needed.

2009-05-10  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: Applied a patch to fix the bug reported in the email:
        http://groups.google.com/group/feed-stats-plugin/browse_thread/thread/4e6d04feefd02f48?hl=en

		Google FeedBurner.
	* templates/troubleshooting.php: Removed the link to FeedBurner.

2009-03-07  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: Tweaked the Google FeedBurner 500 error message to make it
        a bit less awkward.

2009-03-07  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: Added the feed-stats-left-chart-cell, 
        feed-stats-right-chart-cell, feed-stats-left-table-cell, and 
        feed-stats-right-table-cell CSS classes to the top left, top right, bottom
        left, and bottom right table cells of the dashboard page, respectively.
        This allows us to apply specific styles to each cell.
	* style.css.php: Applied CSS styles to all of the aforementioned CSS classes
        so that there is more whitespace on the dashboard page.

2009-03-06  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* fs-comm.php: Made the old and new Awareness API URLs constants so that we 
        can use them in other parts of the plugin easily.

	* feed-stats.php: Implemented the changes (added the $name variable as the 
        first argument) made to the fs_dashboard_url and fs_stats_set_url 
        functions in fs-comm.php.
	* fs-render.php: Added the fs_dashboard_domain($url) function which allows us
        to distinguish between feeds that need account links to feedburner.com and 
        feedburner.google.com.

2009-03-06  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: Added an error message if FeedBurner returns a 500 code 
        for GetItemData but returns the correct data for GetFeedData.  Implemented
        the new fs_have_reach($xml) function to better choose whether to display 
        reach stats while GetItemData is down.
	* fs-comm.php: Improved documentation of fs_fetch_feedburner_data.  Increased
        the amount of data (added the HTTP status code, the raw HTTP body, and 
        the URL) returned from fs_fetch_feedburner_data.
	* fs-parse.php: Tweaked the return message from fs_check_errors for 500 
        status codes. Added the fs_have_reach($xml), which figures out if reach 
        stats can be displayed purely from the XML returned from GetFeedData.
	* fs-render.php: Implemented
        the new fs_have_reach($xml) function to better choose whether to display 
        reach stats while GetItemData is down.

	* templates/header.php: Added <?php if (!defined('WPINC')) die("No 
		outside script access allowed."); ?> to improve security.
	* templates/settings.php: Added <?php if (!defined('WPINC')) die("No

	* feed-stats.php: Rewrote ajax_test_url() to use admin_url() to 
		determine the current location so that the new method of 
		referencing awapi-test.php works.  Changed the 'help' GET 
		variable to 'mode' so that we can accomodate a third page (the 
		testing page) in the admin section.  Set awapi-test.php to be 
		loaded when the 'mode' variable is set to 'test'.  The 
		troubleshooting page is loaded when the 'mode' variable is set 
		to 'help'.  This will accomodate sites that block PHP files not 
		running inside WordPress.
	* js/test.js: Updated test.js to delete the content around the 
		result on the test page. This is to accomodate the changes above.

	* fs-comm.php: Made the plugin give fs_check_errors(...) the http 
		status codes from FeedBurner.
	* fs-parse.php: Made fs_check_errors(...) also check for status 
		codes of 500 and 401, which sometimes are sent by FeedBurner to 
		indicate that the Awareness API is not enabled.  This fixes a bug
		reported by Alexei Lee.

2009-02-19  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: *Significantly* improved the error messages on the 
		dashboard page.  If there's a "Feed Not Found" error from 
		FeedBurner, it states the error, explains it, lists issues that 
		might have caused it, and provides a link to go to the settings 
		page.  If there's no feed URL saved, it asks the user to 
		configure it and provides a link to the settings page.  If the 
		Awareness API isn't enabled, it gives the user instructions and 
		a link to their FeedBurner dashboard page.  If it's none of 
		these, it tells the user probable causes and gives them 
		instructions on how to contact me through the mailing list.

2009-02-18  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* fs-render.php: Patched a PHP warning displayed when there are no 
		views of one's FeedBurner feed.  This issue was reported by 
		Alexei Lee.

2009-02-16  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* fs-comm.php: Fixed fs_fetch_feedburner_data(...).  Made it check 
		the $nourl variable before modifying the user's feed URL.  This 
		fixes a bug reported by Bram Vandenbussche.

2009-02-15  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* readme.txt: Updated to match the change of feed name -> feed URL 
		in the setting box.
	* templates/settings.php: Made 10 days of stats the default.

2009-02-15  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* fs-render.php: Made the "widefat" WordPress CSS class only added 
		to the stats table if WordPress is version 2.7 or above.

2009-02-15  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* style.css.php: Added background images to the waiting, good 
		result, and bad result indicators on the feed tester.
	* templates/header.php: Shortened a GET parameter name.
	* templates/settings.php: Removed the loader icon image.  Re-added as 
		a CSS background image (see above).

2009-02-15  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: Added a CSS class so that we can add a bit of 
		padding around the stats tables.
	* fs-render.php: Added the necessary CSS classes on the stats tables 
		to make them fit in with the new WP 2.7 styling.  Added a thead 
		element around the stats table th elements.
	* style.css.php: Added styling for the tabs on the dashboard that is 
		similar to the tab styling for the media dialog in the editing 
		view of WP 2.7.  

2009-02-15  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: Fixed one method call where the entire data array 
		from fs_fetch_feedburner_data() was being sent rather than just 
		the data.
	* fs-comm.php: Added a semicolon that was missing.
	* fs-parse.php: Added a space for cleanliness.

2009-02-15  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* style.css.php: Tweaked the widths of the text boxes on the 
		settings form.  Tweaked the way versions are detected.
	* templates/header.php: Added the plugin folder name to the 
		parameters sent to the style.css.php file for templating.

2009-02-15  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* awapi-test.php: Added URL decoding to deal with the new format of 
		the feed names.  Modified it to work with the new 
		fs_fetch_feedburner_data() function in fs-comm.php.
	* feed-stats.php: *Removed* sanitize_url due to potential issues 
		down the road.  This will probably need to be reimplemented 
		somewhow else later. Removed the use of fs_check_errors() the new
		fs_fetch_feedburner_data() takes care of this. Modified all of 
		the templates to work with the new return format in 
		fs_fetch_feedburner_data();
	* fs-comm.php: Added fs_fetch_feedburner_data(), which performs 
		pattern matching on the FeedBurner feed URL to determine whether 
		it's a FeedBurner feed (feeds.feedburner.com) or a Google 
		FeedBurner feed (feed2.feedburner.com, feedproxy.google.com).  
		If the user has a feed name (not a full URL) typed in, it will 
		append the feed name to http://feeds.feedburner.com/. If a 
		request to a FeedBurner feed doesn't work, then it will try 
		communicating to a Google FeedBurner feed.  That should ease the 
		transition to Google feeds.  I also modified fs_load_feed_data() 
		and fs_load_item_data() so that they use the 
		fs_fetch_feedburner_data() function.
	* templates/settings.php: Changed feed names to feed URLs in the 
		descriptions. Tweaked text and button styling to fit in with WP 2.7.

2009-02-14  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: Changed "template" to "templates" in the path to 
		the templates directory so that load_template() can find the 
		templates needed to display the plugin.

2009-01-31  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: Moved the header (which contains links to CSS 
		files), the troubleshooting information for the settings page, 
		and the settings form into their own separate template files.  
		Add calls to load_template() to load the template files.
	* templates/settings.php (added): Contains the markup for the 
		settings form that controls this plugin.
	* templates/troubleshooting.php (added): Contains troubleshooting 
		information and descriptions of the various error messages.
	* templates/header.php (added): Contains links to CSS files and 
		conditional comments that apply Internet Explorer-specific 
		styling.

2009-01-31  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* awapi-test.php: Changed the old feedburner.com Awareness API URL 
		to the new feedburner.google.com Awareness API URL.
	* fs-comm.php: Edited the fetch_remote_xml() function to use Troy 
		Wolf's class_http rather than the WordPress 2.7 HTTP API.  This
		will ensure a more consistent experience across different versions
		of WordPress.
	* cache (added): Added a cache directory for class_http to use to 
		temporarily cache Awareness API feeds fetched by the script.

2009-01-29  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	patch by: matrixagent

	* fs-comm.php: Applied matrixagent's patch, which allows the plugin 
		to function with the newer Google FeedBurner feeds.
	* templates (added): Added a templates folder to neatly contain all 
		of the views for different parts of the plugin.  This will make 
		managing the look-and-feel far easier.
	
2008-12-25  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* include (added): Added a folder (sort of like the wp-includes 
		folder) to hold external classes that we're using in the plugin.
	* include/class_http.php (added): Added Troy Wolf's fantastic 
		class_http to use instead of the WordPress 2.7 HTTP API.

2008-12-07  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* readme.txt: Added a section talking about the new Google Group.

2008-11-27  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* readme.txt: Updated for version 1.0.4.  Added Google Chrome to the 
		supported browsers list; tweaked grammar and wording to make it 
		more readable.  Added feed-related words to the tags list, 
		removed "comments."

2008-11-27  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: Removed obsolete CSS styles for IE. Modified the 
		tab markup.  Changed one of the styles for the clear block at 
		the bottom of the Settings page.
	* style.css.php: Rewrote the tabs CSS.

2008-11-27  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: Added a the optiontable class name, which makes 
		the "Feed Stats Options" page look pretty in WordPress 2.3.  
		Added a conditional that only tries to use sanitize_url if the 
		user acutally has it.  This allows the dashboard subpage to work 
		in WordPress 2.3.
	* fs-comm.php: Changed the include_once to a require_once for the 
		new WP 2.7 http.php library. Suppressed warnings for that line 
		as well.  This allows it to work in WordPress 2.3.
	* style.css.php: Added a few extra conditionals and statements to 
		make everything look pretty in WordPress 2.3.

2008-11-27  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* awapi-test.php: Removed error checking code; that has been moved 
		into the fs_check_errors() function.
	* feed-stats.php: Improved troubleshooting information. 
	* fs-parse.php: Improved fs_check_errors().
	* fs-render.php: Improved data checking and message for when there's 
		no data.
	* style.css.php: Tweaked the .fs-message class.

2008-11-27  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* awapi-test.php: Tweaked wording.  Made it load the wp-config.php 
		file rather than getting ABSPATH and WPINC from GET variables. 
		Far more secure.
	* feed-stats.php: Removed ABSPATH and WPINC information that was 
		being passed to awapi-test.php via GET variables.
	* js/test.js: Added lots of comments.  Removed the unnecessary code 
		to send ABSPATH and WPINC variables to awapi-test.php.

2008-11-27  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: Massive code cleanup. Cleaned up the tab code by 
		removing the unnecessary </a> tags and the fs-clr-tab <li> tag. 
		Replaced inline style tags with class names. Removed class names 
		from troubleshooting page.
	* js/test.js: The troubleshooting page now opens in a new window.
	* style.css.php: Changed the tab code from using float to using 
		display: inline.  Added styles for all of the new classnames.  
		Removed the classnames that were removed from the 
		troubleshooting page.

2008-11-27  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* awapi-test.php: Fixed a spelling error in the feed checker.  Did 
		some cleanup of the conditional statement.  Improved the 
		comments.  Included the internationalization library 
		(wp-includes/l10n.php).
	* feed-stats.php: Moved the help onto a separate page. Removed 
		extraneous inline CSS. Bumped the version number.

	* js/test.js: Changed the "What does this mean?" link to point to 
		the new "Troubleshooting" page.
	* style.css.php: Converted from static CSS to dynamic PHP so that we 
		can do templated CSS.  This makes the markup so much more 
		elegant; it allows us to remove all of the extra style tags that 
		we used to add to the header of the admin panel.
	* +   style.css.php (added): style.css was renamed to style.css.php.
	* style.css (deleted): style.css was renamed to style.css.php.

2008-11-21  Jonathan Wilde  <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* awapi-test.php: Included a dummy function for apply_filters() so 
		that http.php in WordPress 2.7 works.
	* fs-comm.php: Added the necessary include files for WordPress' 
		rss.php.

2008-11-20  Jonathan Wilde <speedbreeze@gmail.com>

	* feed-stats.php: Edited the description line so that the link to

		to my site.
