	* awapi-test.php: Fixed a spelling error in the feed checker.  Did 
		some cleanup of the conditional statement.  Improved the 
		comments.  Included the internationalization library 
		(wp-includes/l10n.php).
	* feed-stats.php: Moved the help onto a separate page. Removed 
		extraneous inline CSS. Bumped the version number.
	* fs-comm.php: Cleanup.
	* js/test.js: Changed the "What does this mean?" link to point to 
		the new "Troubleshooting" page.
	* style.css.php: Converted from static CSS to dynamic PHP so that we 
		can do templated CSS.  This makes the markup so much more 
		elegant; it allows us to remove all of the extra style tags that 
		we used to add to the header of the admin panel.
	* +   style.css.php (added): style.css was renamed to style.css.php.
	* style.css (deleted): style.css was renamed to style.css.php.

	* awapi-test.php: Included a dummy function for apply_filters() so 
		that http.php in WordPress 2.7 works.

		rss.php.

	* feed-stats.php: Edited the description line so that the link to 
		the configure page is a relative path rather than one that goes 
		to my site.
