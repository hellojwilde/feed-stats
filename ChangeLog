	* awapi-test.php: Tweaked wording.  Made it load the wp-config.php 
		file rather than getting ABSPATH and WPINC from GET variables. 
		Far more secure.
	* feed-stats.php: Removed ABSPATH and WPINC information that was 
		being passed to awapi-test.php via GET variables.
	* js/test.js: Added lots of comments.  Removed the unnecessary code 
		to send ABSPATH and WPINC variables to awapi-test.php.

		removing the unnecessary </a> tags and the fs-clr-tab <li> tag. 
		Replaced inline style tags with class names. Removed class names 
		from troubleshooting page.
	* js/test.js: The troubleshooting page now opens in a new window.
	* style.css.php: Changed the tab code from using float to using

	* awapi-test.php: Fixed a spelling error in the feed checker.  Did 
		some cleanup of the conditional statement.  Improved the 
		comments.  Included the internationalization library 
		(wp-includes/l10n.php).
	* feed-stats.php: Moved the help onto a separate page. Removed 
		extraneous inline CSS. Bumped the version number.
	* fs-comm.php: Cleanup.
	* js/test.js: Changed the "What does this mean?" link to point to 
		the new "Troubleshooting" page.
	* style.css.php: Converted from static CSS to dynamic PHP so that we 
		can do templated CSS.  This makes the markup so much more 
		elegant; it allows us to remove all of the extra style tags that 
		we used to add to the header of the admin panel.
	* +   style.css.php (added): style.css was renamed to style.css.php.
	* style.css (deleted): style.css was renamed to style.css.php.

	* feed-stats.php: Edited the description line so that the link to

		to my site.
