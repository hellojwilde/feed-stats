	* awapi-test.php: Included a dummy function for apply_filters() so 
		that http.php in WordPress 2.7 works.
	* fs-comm.php: Added the necessary include files for WordPress' 
		rss.php.

	* feed-stats.php: Edited the description line so that the link to 
		the configure page is a relative path rather than one that goes 
		to my site.
